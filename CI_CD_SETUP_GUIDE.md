# 🚀 CI/CD Setup Guide for Laravel Ecommerce App

## 📋 Current Status

Your CI/CD pipeline was failing due to several issues that have now been fixed:

### ✅ Issues Fixed:
1. **Missing environment configuration** - Added proper .env handling
2. **Database configuration** - Fixed phpunit.xml with proper MySQL settings
3. **Missing tests** - Created comprehensive test suite
4. **Workflow dependencies** - Improved workflow structure

## 🔧 New Workflow Structure

### 1. Test Workflow (`.github/workflows/test.yml`)
- **Triggers**: Push/PR to main, master, develop
- **Purpose**: Run tests and ensure code quality
- **Features**:
  - PHP 8.1 setup with all required extensions
  - MySQL 8.0 service
  - Composer dependency caching
  - Database migrations
  - Comprehensive test suite
  - Coverage reporting

### 2. Deploy Workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy-simple-fixed.yml`)
- **Triggers**: After successful tests OR direct push to main/master
- **Purpose**: Deploy to production
- **Features**:
  - Supports both FTP (Hostinger) and SSH (VPS) deployment
  - Asset building
  - Database migrations
  - Cache optimization
  - Permission management

## 🧪 Test Suite

### New Tests Added:
1. **StockServiceTest** - Tests your stock management functionality
2. **ProductTest** - Tests product model functionality

### Test Coverage:
- ✅ Stock decrease functionality
- ✅ Stock increase functionality  
- ✅ Stock availability checking
- ✅ Product creation and management
- ✅ Color-specific stock management

## 🔑 Required GitHub Secrets

### For FTP Deployment (Hostinger):
```
FTP_SERVER=ftp.yourdomain.com
FTP_USERNAME=your_username@domain.com
FTP_PASSWORD=your_ftp_password
FTP_REMOTE_DIR=/public_html
```

### For SSH Deployment (VPS/Dedicated):
```
SERVER_HOST=your-server-ip-or-domain.com
SERVER_USER=root
SSH_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_ssh_key
PROJECT_PATH=/var/www/html/your-project
SERVER_PORT=22
```

## 🚀 How to Set Up

### Step 1: Configure GitHub Secrets
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
3. Add the required secrets based on your deployment method

### Step 2: Test the Pipeline
1. Make a small change to your code
2. Commit and push to main/master branch
3. Go to **Actions** tab in GitHub
4. Watch the workflow run

### Step 3: Monitor Results
- **Green checkmark** ✅ = Success
- **Red X** ❌ = Failure (check logs for details)

## 🔍 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### 1. Database Connection Issues
**Problem**: Tests fail with database connection errors
**Solution**: 
- Check MySQL service is running
- Verify database credentials in phpunit.xml
- Ensure proper wait time for MySQL startup

### 2. Missing Dependencies
**Problem**: Composer install fails
**Solution**:
- Check composer.json is valid
- Ensure all required PHP extensions are installed
- Clear composer cache if needed

### 3. Test Failures
**Problem**: Tests fail unexpectedly
**Solution**:
- Check test database is properly set up
- Verify all required models and services exist
- Run tests locally first: `php artisan test`

### 4. Deployment Issues
**Problem**: Deployment fails
**Solution**:
- Verify all secrets are correctly set
- Check server permissions
- Ensure deployment path exists
- Test SSH/FTP connection manually

## 📊 Monitoring Your CI/CD

### GitHub Actions Dashboard
- Go to your repository → **Actions** tab
- View all workflow runs
- Click on any run to see detailed logs
- Check individual step results

### Key Metrics to Watch:
- **Test Success Rate**: Should be 100%
- **Deployment Time**: Usually 2-5 minutes
- **Test Coverage**: Aim for >80%

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Set up GitHub secrets** for your deployment method
2. **Push a test commit** to trigger the pipeline
3. **Monitor the first run** and fix any issues

### Optional Improvements:
1. **Add more tests** for your specific business logic
2. **Set up Slack notifications** for deployment status
3. **Add code quality checks** (PHPStan, PHP CS Fixer)
4. **Implement staging environment** for testing before production

## 🆘 Getting Help

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check the logs** in GitHub Actions
2. **Run tests locally**: `php artisan test`
3. **Verify secrets** are correctly configured
4. **Test deployment manually** first

## 🎉 Success Indicators

Your CI/CD is working correctly when you see:
- ✅ All tests pass
- ✅ Deployment completes successfully
- ✅ Your website updates automatically
- ✅ No manual intervention required

---

**Your CI/CD pipeline is now properly configured and should work reliably!** 🚀
